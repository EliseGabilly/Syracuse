# Syracuse
Illustration of the flying time of any number for the Syracuse conjecture.
Also kown as : 3n + 1 problem, the 3n + 1 conjecture, the Ulam conjecture, Kakutani's problem, the Thwaites conjecture, Hasse's algorithm, the Syracuse problem or the Collatz conjecture.
The function is f(n)=n/2 if (mod2) else f(n)=3n+1. The conjecture say that for any starting n the runtine will end at 1.

If we extend the problem to f(n)=n/2 or f(n)=a*n+b, the routine will start to loop.
